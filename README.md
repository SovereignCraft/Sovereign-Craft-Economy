# Sovereign Craft Economy Plugin

**A Minecraft plugin that fuses Vault with the wild world of LNBits!**

Welcome to the **Sovereign Craft Economy Plugin**—a chaotic, electrifying bridge between Minecraft's Vault economy and the lightning-fast LNBits ecosystem. This isn’t your average plugin; it’s a beast that demands serious infrastructure, a fearless spirit, and maybe a touch of madness.

---

## ⚡️ What It Does
This plugin lets your Minecraft server run an economy powered by Bitcoin's Lightning Network via [LNBits](https://lnbits.com/). Deposit, withdraw, and trade with real *sats*—because why settle for fake coins when you can wield the power of decentralized finance in-game?

---

## 🚨 Prerequisites (Good Luck!)
To unleash this beast, you’ll need:
- **A Bitcoin node with Lightning**: Fully synced and ready to rumble.
- **LNBits**: Hooked up and humming alongside your node.
- **Nearline Node**: Your node better be cozy with your server—lag is your enemy here.
- **A Few Million Sats**: Liquidity isn’t cheap. Reliable deposits and withdrawals don’t grow on trees.
- **Vault**: The Minecraft economy backbone—don’t leave home without it.

> **Warning**: Economy plugins that spam balance checks (like tab list updates) will choke your node faster than you can say "blockchain." This setup is NOT for the faint of heart.

## 🔥 Why You Shouldn’t Run This (But I Know You’re Tempted)
Let’s be real—this plugin is a labor of love built for *my* server. Here’s why you’d have to be a certified psychopath to try it on yours:
- **Financial Risk**: Sats don’t mess around. One wrong move, and your wallet’s toast.
- **Node Management**: It’s a part-time gig. Syncing, channels, liquidity—hope you like babysitting tech.
- **Infrastructure Hell**: DNS, proxies, LNAddress, web wallets, LNDhub—the list goes on. You’re the sysadmin now.
- **Lag Nightmares**: A distant node = a laggy server. Your players will riot.

*Seriously, don’t do it. Or do. I’m not your mom.*

## 🛠️ Support? Ha!
This plugin comes with **zero support** for anyone but me. You’re on your own, brave soul. No hand-holding, no troubleshooting, no “how do I set up my node?” DMs. Figure it out—or don’t. Your call.

## 🌟 For the Sovereign Crafters
This was forged in the fires of my own experimentation at [SovereignCraft](https://github.com/SovereignCraft). If you’re crazy enough to fork it, tweak it, or worship it, be my guest. Just don’t expect it to be easy.

## 📜 License
Check the repo for the nitty-gritty. Spoiler: It’s open-source, but that doesn’t mean it’s *friendly*.

*Current vibe: sipping coffee, watching my node hum, and laughing at the chaos I’ve unleashed.*
