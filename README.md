The Sovereign Craft Economy Plugin
A Minecraft plugin that bridges Vault to LNBits
This plugin requires a significant amount of infrastructure and expense to operate. You must be running a Bitcoin node with lightning and LNBits and the node must be very nearline to the server to avoid severe lag. NO economy plugins that pull balances constantly like a user tab list can be used without overwhelming the node either. This is mostly intended for my own purposes as even establishing enough liquidity to have reliable deposits and withdraws would likely be at least a few million sats. You would likely have to be a psycopath to run this on your own Minecraft server, seriously, don’t do it... There’s financial risks, and managing the node alone is a part time job. Oh, and good luck with all the DNS, proxy, etc. Needed for LNAddress, the webwallet, LNDhub, and all the rest to work. You’ll be on your own for that. This plugin provides NO support for others.
