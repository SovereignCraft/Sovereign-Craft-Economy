# Sovereign Craft Economy Plugin

**A Minecraft plugin that fuses Vault API to Bitcoin with LNBits!**

Welcome to the **Sovereign Craft Economy Plugin**—a maximalist, uncompromising bridge between Minecraft's Vault economy & LNBits. This isn’t your average economy plugin; it’s a beast that demands serious infrastructure, passion, and maybe a touch of madness.

---

## ⚡️ What It Does
This plugin lets your Minecraft server run an economy powered by Bitcoin's Lightning Network via [LNBits](https://lnbits.com/). Deposit, withdraw, and trade with real *sats*—because Bitcoin, being the best money, allows for this. So, we're going to do it GFY!

---

## 🚨 Prerequisites (Good Luck!)
To unleash this beast, you’ll need:
- **A Bitcoin node with Lightning**: Fully synced and funded with good liquidity, backups, security, and more.
- **LNBits**: operational and set up with appropriate firewall rules and DNS for LNAddresses, Webwallet, and more.
- **Nearline Node**: Your node better be very low latency with your server—lag is your enemy here. Oh, and do you really want your node on the same subnet as a public minecraft server?
- **A Few Million Sats (minimum)**: Liquidity isn’t cheap. Reliable deposits and withdrawals don’t grow on trees.

> **Warning**: Economy plugins that spam balance checks (like tab list updates) will choke your node faster than ordinals on the Timechain. This setup is NOT for the faint of heart.

## 🔥 Why You Shouldn’t Run This (Seriously)
Let’s be real, this plugin is a labor of love built for *my* server. Here’s why you’d have to be a certified psychopath to try it on yours:
- **Financial Risk**: Bitcoin doesn’t mess around. There's no faucet and settlement is final. One wrong move, and your wallet, and your players' wallets your node, or balance is toast.
- **Node Management**: Is at least a part-time gig. Syncing, channels, liquidity hope you like babysitting tech directly tied to money.
- **Infrastructure Hell**: DNS, proxies, LNDhub, the list goes on. You’re the sysadmin, programmer, banker, webadmin, and customer support rep now.
- **Lag Nightmares**: A slow node = a laggy server. Your players will riot.

*Seriously, don’t do it. Or do. Because freedom comes first.*

## 🛠️ Support? Ha!
This plugin comes with **zero support** for anyone but me. You’re on your own, brave soul. No hand-holding, no troubleshooting, no “how do I set up my node?” DMs. Figure it out, actually don't. See above.

## 🌟 For the Sovereign Crafters
This was forged in the fires of my own desires, passion and learning at [SovereignCraft](https://sovereigncraft.com). If you’re crazy enough to fork it, tweak it, or worship it, be my guest. Just don’t expect it to be easy.
